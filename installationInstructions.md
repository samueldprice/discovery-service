- Setup a serverless account (free is ok)
- Setup an AWS account (free should be ok)
- Install node, at least version 12 but I had troubles so used version 14
- Install serverless globally
```npm install -g serverless
- Configure Serverless Framework AWS Credentials
```https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/
- Basically follow the serverless guide:
```https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/
- but the code is already done its here, thats what this is, so you dont need to: 'Create a new Service from a Template'
- but you will need to do the deploy
```sls deploy
