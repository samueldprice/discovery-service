# New to serverless
- I chose to use serverless as it seems to be a pre-built solution for deploying node to AWS lambdas and also includes CI/CD features.
- The documentation for serverless is mostly around Javascript with little information about Typescript.
- Some of the documentation appears to be out of date and a few wrong turns were made.
- Support for non-yml configuration files appears to be partial

# New to dynamo via node
- Previously I'd used dynamo via C#
- The Typescript definitions for the AWS SDK appear to be out of date
